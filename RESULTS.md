#My results for *math.js*

- **double** - This worked as expected, doubling the number.

- **square** - This worked as epected, squaring the number.

- **isEven** - This surprisingly worked as expected, checking whether the number was even and semi-reliably handling other cases.  I had hoped that it would handle something that was not a number reliably, but it did  not.  It did however handle strings like "cat" as expected.

- **isOdd** - This initially broke somewhat--not the mechanics of it, but the returned result because I copied and pasted.  It demonstrated the perils of copy/paste when something is flipped--in this case, I changed my logic, and did not accordingly adjust the confirmation or refutation output.  Fortunately, I had not commited it yet, so I didn't have to commit twice.

- **multiply** - This initially failed, but only I used square brackets instead of curlies.  Muscle memory is not there yet for that long bracket reach.
